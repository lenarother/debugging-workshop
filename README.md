# Debugging

Debugging your code is a skill of its own.
Let's practice and exchange experiences on debating tools and techniques.

## Challenge: Maze Generator 

The market-leading energy company has a new promotional strategy.
It is a game, in which a gnome must find a heat pump in a maze.
The first iteration is to generate a random maze.
It might look like this:


```

    ##########
    #.#...#..#
    #........#
    #..##.##.#
    #.#..#...#
    #..#.....#
    ##.##.##.#
    #........#
    #...#....#
    ##########

```

In [`generate_maze_buggy.py`](generate_maze_buggy.py) you find a basic implementation of the algorithm.
However, it is **very buggy**. There are about 20 bugs in the program.
